gulp-traceur-demo
=================

This is a demonstration of using gulp-traceur to generate ES5 code from ES6 code and generate sourcemaps.
Currently sourcemap files are not being generated!

To run this:

1. npm install -g gulp (if not already done)
2. npm install (to install dependencies in package.json)
3. gulp (to attempt to generate sourcemap files)
