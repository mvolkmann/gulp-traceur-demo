gulp-traceur-demo
=================

This is a demonstration of using gulp-traceur to generate ES5 code from ES6 code and generate sourcemaps.
Despite the name of the repo, it also demonstrates doing the same things with Grunt.

To run this:

1. npm install -g gulp (if not already done)
2. npm install -g grunt-cli (if not already done)
3. npm install (to install dependencies in package.json)
4. gulp (to generate ES5 and sourcemap files)
5. grunt (to generate ES5 and sourcemap files)
